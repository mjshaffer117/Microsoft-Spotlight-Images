# Microsoft-Spotlight-Images
Copy and name images from Microsoft Spotlight location for easy access

The main purpose of this script is to make is easier to find the "randomized background" images that Microsoft implemented into Windows.
The script finds the folder location and copies the contents (as long as the file size exceeds 120KB) to a temporary folder on the users desktop.
All applicable file names are then renamed to include the '.png' extension making the image files viewable.

The user is then able to go through the images and save them in a separate location, or save the images as a new background.
The temporary folder and unwanted files can then be deleted by the user.
